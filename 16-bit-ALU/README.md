# 16-bit ALU using FPGA (Basys3 Board)

## Overview
This project implements a 16-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) using Verilog HDL and is synthesized on a Basys3 FPGA development board. The ALU performs basic arithmetic and logic operations based on input control signals.

## Features
- Addition, Subtraction
- Bitwise AND, OR, XOR, NOT
- Shift Left, Shift Right
- Comparison operations (Zero, Negative)

## Tools Used
- Xilinx Vivado
- Basys3 FPGA Board
- Verilog HDL

## Architecture
The ALU design is modular and includes:
- ALU Control Unit
- Arithmetic Block
- Logic Block
- Shifter Unit
- Comparator

## Simulation & Testing
Testbenches were written in Verilog to validate all operations. Simulations were run using Vivado simulator.

## Outcome
The ALU was successfully synthesized and implemented on the Basys3 board. It performs all operations based on control inputs and displays results on the 7-segment and LEDs.
