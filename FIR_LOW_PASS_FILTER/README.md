# Digital FIR Low Pass Filter
Building a 9-tap Finite Impulse Response (FIR) lowpass filter.
## Overview
This project implements a Digital Low Pass FIR (Finite Impulse Response) Filter using Verilog HDL. The design includes modules for the FIR filter and CORDIC-based sine/cosine signal generation, along with their testbenches, aimed at simulation and verification of filter response.

## Functional Description
- The `FIR` module receives a digital input (e.g., a sinusoidal signal) and filters out frequencies above the designed cut-off.
- The `sincos.v` module generates sine and cosine waveforms, serving as test signals for the filter.
- Testbenches (`FIR_tb.v` and `sincos_tb.v`) provide automated simulation scenarios and stimulus, checking for expected outputs.



- üìå Target cutoff frequency: ~10MHz.
  üí° Sampling clock frequency: 100MHz.

## 2. Filter Implementation
- üìà Synthesizing two sine waves for testing.
- üìâ First sine wave frequency: 2MHz.
- üìä Second sine wave frequency: 30MHz.

## 3. Testbench Design
- ‚ûï Addition of the two sine waves to create a "noisy" signal.
- üîÑ Resampling of the noisy signal at 100MHz.

## 4. Signal Generation
- üìâ Attenuation of the 30MHz component of the noisy signal.
- ‚úÖ Preservation of the 2MHz component of the noisy signal.

## 6. Visual Representation of Signals
- üìâ Clear attenuation of the 30MHz component.
- ‚úÖ Unchanged 2MHz component, confirming lowpass action.
- üìä Visual confirmation of filter performance.

## How to Run
1.  Generate and integrate CORDIC IP core for `sincos.v` using Xilinx Vivado.
2. Compile all Verilog files in your preferred simulator.
3. Run `sincos_tb.v` to verify waveform generation.
4. Run `FIR_tb.v` to simulate the filter response to test signals.
5. View results using the simulator‚Äôs waveform viewer.

## Additional Notes
- Ensure that all module and signal names match between main modules and testbenches.
- Modify filter coefficients in `FIR.v` as needed for your application.
- For hardware realization, add appropriate constraints and top-level integration.

## Future Scope
